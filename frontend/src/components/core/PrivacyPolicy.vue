    <h2>Sharing of Data</h2>
    <p>We don't share your Personal Information with third parties, unless it is in accordance with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service. From time to time aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Websites and its services. We currently use Google Analytics, Cloudflare, Matomo, and NitroPay. Feel free to check out their own privacy policies to find out more.</p>
    <p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our &ldquo;<strong>Agents</strong>&rdquo;).

You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.</p>
    <p>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <h2>Tracking User Behavior</h2>
    <p>Method may keep track of the websites and pages users visit within the Websites, in order to determine what Website services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the Websites to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
    <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by the Websites. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Websites.</p>
    <h2>Social Media Accounts</h2>
    <p>If you choose to do so you may link to your Website profile or login to certain Websites using your Battle.net, Discord, Google, Patreon, or Twitter account (the "<strong>Social Media Accounts</strong>") to assist in user account management. When you do so we also gain access to some of the information stored on your Social Media Accounts. We may use this information such as interests or preferences to group you with other people with similar interests or preferences and place you into a market segment.</p>
    <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>The Websites use cookies and/or similar technologies (collectively referred to as &ldquo;<strong>Cookies</strong>&ldquo;). A Cookie is a small bit of record-keeping information that many websites and other online products and services often store on a user&rsquo;s computer or device in order to identify it and associate activity with it.</p>
    <p>When visiting the Websites you may have options to enable or disallow Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline Cookies, if you do not want to accept them. We use Cookies to optimize your visit, make your browsing and/or user experience as effective as possible, and let you know about features that we think will interest you. This means that if you disallow Cookies, your use of the Websites may not include all the Website features. If you browse the Websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual device.</p>
    <p>By using the Websites you agree, and consent, to receive Cookies unless you manage your cookie setting options.</p>
    <p>Please also note that the use of information obtained by certain third party providers is also subject to their own privacy policies and may differ from ours.</p>
    <h2>Children Under Thirteen</h2>
    <p>Method does not knowingly collect or store any Personal Information from children under thirteen (13) in the United States or under the relevant age threshold in other jurisdictions where the child is located. If you are under thirteen (13) years old in the United States, or under the relevant age threshold in the jurisdiction where you are located, you cannot use the Websites without the permission of your parent or guardian.</p>
    <p>However, we may collect technical information required for delivering the service and for the support of our internal operations from all users of our Websites. If parents or guardians believe that we have unintentionally collected their children&rsquo;s Personal Information or otherwise used their children&rsquo;s Personal Information for another purpose, they may reach out to us&nbsp; at <span><a href="mailto:contact@wago.io">contact@wago.io</a></span>. Parents should contact us immediately if they have any concerns.</p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>The Websites contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site, and to read the privacy policy and terms of use of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h2>Security of your Personal Information </h2>
    <p>Method takes a range of security measures designed to protect your Personal Information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information).</p>
    <p>We also take steps to ensure that the Personal Information collected is protected from misuse and alteration. In addition, we request vendors who process Personal Information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your Personal Information.</p>
    <p>However, the internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the internet which are beyond our control; and (b) complete security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the Websites cannot therefore be guaranteed.</p>
